## Agentic Workflow

This project follows a **plan-then-implement** cycle:

1. **Plan** — Use `/feature`, `/bug`, or `/chore` to generate a structured plan. Plans are saved to `specs/`.
2. **Implement** — Run `/implement specs/<plan-file>.md` to execute the plan step by step.

Plans include validation commands that must pass before work is considered done.

---

## Conventions

- All plans go to `specs/` with descriptive filenames (e.g. `specs/add-user-auth.md`).
- Every plan must include validation commands (test, lint, build, etc.).
- Never claim a task is done without running the validation commands.
- Use "THINK HARD" when a problem requires deep reasoning or careful analysis.
- Read `README.md` before making changes to understand project context.
- Commit messages follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.).
